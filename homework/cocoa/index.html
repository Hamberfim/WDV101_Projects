        <h3>Where does <strong>cocoa</strong> come from?</h3>
        <h4><strong>Cocoa</strong> is the essential ingredient for our chocolate.</h4>

        <p>It originates from the seeds (<strong>cocoa</strong> beans) of the <strong>cocoa</strong> fruits (<strong>cocoa</strong> pods), which grow on <strong><strong>cocoa</strong></strong> trees. The production of <strong>cocoa</strong> begins in the tropical regions around the Equator, where the hot and humid climate is well suited for growing <strong>cocoa</strong> trees. 70% of the world’s <strong>cocoa</strong> beans come from four West African countries: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast" target="_blank">Ivory Coast</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana%E2%80%93Nigeria_relations" target="_blank">Ghana, Nigeria</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon" target="_blank">Cameroon</a>. The Ivory Coast and Ghana are by far the two largest producers of <strong>cocoa</strong>: together they cultivate more than half of the world´s <strong>cocoa</strong>. These two are followed by other <strong>cocoa</strong> producing countries like Indonesia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Brazil and Ecuador.</p>
        <p>Worldwide, 90% of <strong>cocoa</strong> is grown on small family farms of 2 to 5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare" target="_blank">hectares</a>, while just 5% comes from large plantations of 40 hectares or more. <strong>cocoa</strong> production provides livelihoods for between 40 and 50 million farmers, rural workers and their families in the Global South. In the Ivory Coast and Ghana up to 90% of the farmers rely on <strong>cocoa</strong> for their primary income.</p>
        <h4>From trees to sacks</h4>
        <p>Growing <strong>cocoa</strong> is hard manual work and very labour intensive, as caring for and harvesting the beans requires close and continuous attention. The <strong>cocoa</strong> tree flowers and bears fruit throughout the entire year. It produces large <strong>cocoa</strong> pods, which need to be cut from the trees by machetes or sticks. Each <strong>cocoa</strong> pod contains around 20 to 30 seeds sitting in a sweet white pulp – these are the actual <strong>cocoa</strong> beans. It takes a whole year’s crop from one tree to make half a kilo of <strong>cocoa</strong>. As pods do not ripen at the same time, the trees need to be monitored continuously. <strong>cocoa</strong> is also a very delicate crop, easily affected by changes in weather and susceptible to diseases and pests. After the harvest, the ripe pods need to be cut open with machetes and the beans are taken out. The <strong>cocoa</strong> beans then need to be fermented, dried, cleaned and packed. When the beans are packed into <strong>cocoa</strong> sacks, the farmers are ready to sell the product to intermediaries.</p>
        <h4 class="wider">From sacks to <span class="wider">butter</span></h4>
        <p>Intermediaries buy the sacks of unprocessed beans and sell them to exporters. When the beans reach the grinding companies in the global North, the <strong>cocoa</strong> still needs to be processed. The beans are crushed and the shells removed, roasted, and finally ground. The result – <strong>cocoa</strong> liquor – is used to manufacture chocolate, or is further processed for <strong>cocoa</strong> butter and <strong>cocoa</strong> powder.</p>
