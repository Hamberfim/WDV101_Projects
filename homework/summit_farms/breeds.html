            Alaskan breeds are amongst the oldest domestic breed of dogs. They have a powerful and sturdy physique with a lot of strength, stamina and endurance. They usually resemble a wolf and play the role of a wolf in many movies. Alaskan breeds are a very intelligent dog which displays a lot of independence and needs exercise regularly. They are a very playful breed, always accept challenges and never turn out to be boring. These breeds are not recommended for the first time dog purchaser as the stubbornness and independent nature of the dog is so challenging and difficult to handle. But they are affectionate, loyal, dignified and playful. These breeds have a life span of 12 to 16 years of age.
