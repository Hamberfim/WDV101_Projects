        <p>Summit Farms is recognized for producing outstanding Alaskan dogs.  Our dogs come from champion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sled_dog" title="Sled Dogs" target="_blank">sled dog</a> bloodlines and excel in every venue.  We breed selectively for structure, temperament, and ability.  Summit Farms Collies have been placed in homes around the world and make excellent working dogs and family companions. These are special puppies from of our finest sires and dams. If you have never owned an Alaskan dog this breed is not for everyone. See Facts About Alaskan Dogs for more information.</p>
        <p>One of the most rewarding parts of working with dogs is developing a lifelong relationship with them. We always enjoy our experiences with our puppies. We are actively pursuing our goal of training the best possible dogs. We are committed to providing our them with the best possible care, the best possible nutrition, a clean healthy environment, and we define "winning" as spending the most time possible with our dogs.</p>
        <p>While the breeding has been our dream, it pales in comparison to the experience of living with dogs. Caring for animals with Olympic level training is hard work. They are our friends, comrades, co-workers, family. We strive to give them the very best care.</p>
        <p>Our website is designed to operate as a door to our services. We hope that it will be easy to view our dogs and their accomplishments. So come on in, enjoy your visit, and come again. Feel free to contact us with questions, comments, or just to say hi.</p>
