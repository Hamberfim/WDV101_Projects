        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing a CIS degree part-time at DMACC (expected graduation 2022).</p>
        <p>I will complete a Java Certificate in the Spring of 2020 followed by a SQL Application Development
            Certificate in the Fall of 2020 (dependent on course sequence availability).</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning and I've done a lot of self-directed educational pursuits over the years. But one of the
            main areas that I felt needed more structured learning was in my understanding of programming logic,
            application design and development. So I recently returned to DMACC to pursue a degree in Computer
            Information Systems. I'm interested in merging my past skills and work experiences with the new skills
            gained from a computer science degree.</p>
        <p> I admit that at times my curiosity and enjoyment of learning can be a distraction as I have accidentally
            followed a tangent farther than my commitment to the subject warranted. But DMACC's CIS program has been
            huge in keeping me on track and focused on the relevant skills that I'm looking to enhance. A lot of that is
            a direct reflection of the instructors and I can't say how much I appreciate their enthusiasm and commitment
            to educating the students in their classes.</p>
        <p>My goal is to enter back into the workforce sometime before finishing up the degree. An ideal employment
            position for me would have some visual aspects with a pairing of technical challenges and some variation on
            the type of work being done.</p>
