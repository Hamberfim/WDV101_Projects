        <p>We are an AKC Breeder of Merit, and are committed to meeting and exceeding the guidelines set forth by the AKC regarding membership, health screening, and animal registration.  We are also proud members of the American Alaskan Dog Association.</p>
        <p>Brad and Stacie are originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts" target="_blank">Massachusetts</a>. They has been involved with dogs their whole life, Brad grandfather and godfather raised beagles, and always loved being around the dogs. As a kids the only thing their parents could get them to read were accounts of polar explorers getting stranded in the ice and watching their ships get crushed by the ice and making a heroic dash to land with their sled dogs.</p>
        <p>Brad and Stacie moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska" title="Alaska" target="_blank">Alaska</a> in 1975 to help build a team of dogs for the Iditarod. Since then they have worked hard as breeders and to build their home and kennel. It is one of those things that takes you back to a time or place. Maybe it is the smell of your grandmother’s basement. Maybe it is a song that makes you remember a certain summer. There is something about this time of year. I get the feeling when I look out the windows in the morning and I am able to see the mountains. The feeling comes again in the evening when the kennel is still light after dinner. I feel it when I am filling the stove in the morning. It is the extended daylight. It is the feeling of the snow under my feet, much harder than it is mid-winter, from the warmth of the sun heating it in the day, the cold of the night freezing it like concrete. All of these moments give me a feeling, a glimpse of a memory. It sends me to a different time and place. It makes me feel Iditarod.</p>
