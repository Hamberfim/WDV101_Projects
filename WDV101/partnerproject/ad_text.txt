Looking for space, comfort and sustainable living?  This is the perfect home for you!

Sip your morning coffee listening to the birds chirp on your large desk.  Or enjoy the sunshine on the front porch as your dinner cooks in the new kitchen.  The bedroom suite is warm and cozy, which provides a desirable place to retreat when those cold Iowa winters blow outside.  And know that on those sunny days, your solar panels on the room are collecting the energy for your use later.

This home is in a fantastic location with easy access to Iowa State University, bike paths, bus line and lovely neighborhood shops.  We just finished an extensive renovation including a brand new kitchen, new flooring throughout the living space and new laundry room.  All new energy-star appliances and light bulbs for maximum energy savings on your bill.

Things you’ll want to know:
1) There are two bedrooms and 1 full bath.
2) There’s a new gas furnace, air conditioning and gas stove.
3) There is off street parking and additional bike parking in a securable shed.

This home has been renovated to code to include extra insulation and fire protection.  You’ll appreciate the extra details and extra efforts that went into creating a fantastic home. 

We are pet friendly with additional pet deposit.  One year lease is available for $950 per month.  All utilities are included.

The house is available now.  Please call Melanie at 515-999-0000 or complete the form below and we’ll contact you to set up an appointment.
