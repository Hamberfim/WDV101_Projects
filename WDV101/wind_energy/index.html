                        <p>Wind energy (<strong><em>or wind power</em></strong>) refers to the <strong>process of
                                creating
                                electricity
                                using the
                                wind</strong>, or air flows that
                            occur naturally in the earth’s atmosphere. Modern wind turbines are used to capture kinetic
                            energy
                            from
                            the
                            wind and generate electricity.</p>

                            rather the defining characteristic of Windmills. But a number of theories
                            concerning Windmills exist. Joyce denies the postconceptual Windmills in a discourse where
