        <h3>14119 WDV101 Homework Projects</h3>
        <p>While I was familar with web design and developemnt before starting this class I haven't been involved in it for about 10 years. Enough has changes since that time that I felt it worth it to take the class. Plus it's required to get into Intro to JavaScript and an elective for my degree...win-win.</p>
        <p>There have been some significant changes since I left the field. HTML5 and CSS3 have pretty much been fully adopted. Browser companies are playing nicey-nicey with Web Standards. Browsers, while the war for dominace has settled down and identical, full support still isn't complete accross the board they are a lot more friendler to deal with than in the early days.</p>
        <p>It used to be a one-trick-pony town. ADOBE, ABOBE, ADOBE. We have in browser developer tools. A crazy amount of opensource apps and tools to help you design and develope sites. Responsive content for mutiple devices. Internet Explorer still sucks though, so that hasn't changed. And Joomla lost trackion to other off-the-shelf content managment systems. I was supprised but the WordPress community just blew up big. CSS Grid is awesome and the ability to design a site like a magazine layout is pretty much here. Plus, the ability to find an answer to any issue is within the reach of your keyboard instead of some outdated reference book. HUZZAH! </p>
